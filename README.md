CraftLib is a crafting library that handles custom items in crafting recipes and ensures custom items cannot be used in regular recipes.

## Usage
If you are a server operator, download CraftLib [here](https://github.com/Rausy/craft-lib/releases). It does not do anything on its own, it simply allows other plugins to function.

If you are a developer, you can read a tutorial [here](https://github.com/Rausy/craft-lib/wiki) on how to use it.
